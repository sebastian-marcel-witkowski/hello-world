Hello there! 

My name is Sebastian Marcel Witkowski and I am a recent graduate with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from Northwestern University. Please
feel free to take a look at my portfolio, and if you have any questions, or would simply like to contact/collaborate on a project with me, please shoot me a message at sebastian.marcel.witkowski@gmail.com. While I specialize in hardware design and engineering, I love to program in almost any language and can very quickly pick any language(s) necessary. [Although if there are any hardware people out there that would like to work with me in designing a RGB LED cube or USB fightstick peripheral that could work on any console (mainly the Switch so I could play Ultra Street Fighter 2 the way it was meant to be played) please let me know!] 

Hope you have a great day and best of luck with your projects!

Sebastian Marcel Witkowski
